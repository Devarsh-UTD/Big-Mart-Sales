# The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.

We will be going through the following steps :-

1) Hypothesis Generation – generating different hypothesis that can impact the outcome
2) Data Exploration – looking at categorical and continuous feature summaries and making inferences about the data.
3) Data Cleaning – imputing missing values in the data and checking for outliers
4) Feature Engineering – modifying existing variables and creating new ones for analysis
5) Model Building – making predictive models on the data

I will be using R for most of the programming along with python for encoding
